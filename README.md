# OSTEP

Code and experiments from _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_ by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau.

This repository contains C programs and lab work inspired by the book, focusing on processes, memory, file systems, threads, and scheduling.

## Goals

- Build working intuition of OS internals
- Reinforce systems programming in C
- Explore scheduling, virtual memory, and concurrency through hands-on examples
